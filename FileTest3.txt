o truant muse, what shall be thy amends 
for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed? 
both truth and beauty on my love depends; 
so dost thou too, and therein dignified. 
make answer, muse: wilt thou not haply say 
'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd; 
beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay; 
but best is best, if never intermix'd?' 
because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb? 
excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee 
to make him much outlive a gilded tomb, 
and to be praised of ages yet to be. 
then do thy office, muse; i teach thee how 
to make him seem long hence as he shows now.
